# ML-NeuralNet-Alzheimer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alzheimer_neural_net is a continuation of a project that is available on kaggle.com
https://www.kaggle.com/hyunseokc/detecting-early-alzheimer-s

The authors of this project did not publish results from a neural network, so this project runs the data through an optimized neural network that was
able to acheive 89.6% accuracy in predicting if a patient will develop Alzheimers.
